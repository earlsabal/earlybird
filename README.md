## Description

My team and I identified the difficulty new freelance developers have obtaining clients. In response to the need, we created a platform that assists web developers in identifying potential customers by finding successful businesses with either poorly constructed websites or no website at all. We used a series of modern technologies with a Service Oriented Architecure to maximize scalability and compatability. I also dove into a new language and framework in Elixir and Phoenix and built a working API app to help support the main functionality of the project. Multi-threading was also implemented to sigificantly cut processing time. 

Technologies we used were: 
- Ruby on Rails
- Phoenix with Elixir
- Slackbot
- Swift
- React.js
- Yelp API
- Google API
- Multi-Threading
