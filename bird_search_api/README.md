Bird Search API
===

Bird Search API is a backend search application for the Early Bird platform.  Bird Search API sends a list of buisnesses in need of new websites to the front end  platforms based on the search term and zip code entered. The Early Bird platform connects web developers with local businesses potentially in need of their services. Utilizing an advanced search algorithm (EarlyPeacock) built by the Early Bird team (http://www.github.com/EarlyRavens), the Early Bird platform includes an iOS application (EarlyEmu), a React web application (EarlyPenguin), and a Slack application (EarlyRaven), all connected through EarlyPhoenix.

## Motivation

We created this project to help connect web developers to local businesses that might benefit from their services and affordable rates.  This EarlyPhoenix aspect of the project is a way to have some restricted access to our EarlyBird website.  With this we have a lot of opportunities that we can build on this project in the future.
